# This is everything that I learned and practiced before my Frontend/JavaScript interviews

## Some goals:

- CSS: Specificity, Box model, Layout, Positioning
- JavaScript: this keyword, Prototypes, closures, Async-style code, Promises, Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
- JavaScript design patterns: Observer pattern, Module pattern
- HTML: Event delegation (it was useful in almost every interview), DOM traversal, DOM manipulation, Form validation and submission
